# PythonGame

Tetris
Implemented the game on python canvas.


Invaders
This is a game called Invaders.
It acts similar to Space invaders. Basically, you are facing a bunch of enemy ships rushing towards you and shooting you. You need to shoot them down to earn scores. If you hit an enemy ship, you can destroy it, but you will lost one life. You got 10 lives in total. If you hit the boss, you lose immediately. If you are able to destroy the boss, you win!
The commands are quite easy. The directions keys(up, down, left, right) move your own ship. “r” to start, “p” to pause, and “c” to continue.
